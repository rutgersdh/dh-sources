## DH Sources

This repository is used to maintain and publish a list of datasets and archival collections with a Rutgers connection, however interpreted. Librarians and archivists participating in the Digital Humanities Working Group at Rutgers University Libraries began this list in 2017 with the ["Collections as Data"](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/) framework in mind. *DH Sources* includes datasets associated with subscription databases, digitized archival collections, and datasets created by Rutgers-affiliated researchers. It is meant to serve as a reference for Rutgers digital humanists looking for datasets to use in their teaching and research.

List published at <https://rutgersdh.github.io/dh-sources/>. If you have edits or additions to make, please feel free to send us a pull request or file an issue.
