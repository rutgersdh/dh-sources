## DH Sources

### 2025

This list was recently refreshed and updated with some library sources for text and data mining (TDM). It is not considered exhaustive, merely a good starting point for any Rutgers researcher interested in computational text analysis. A note that most Rutgers University Libraries databases do not allow automated or bulk downloads within existing contracts. Please [contact the Libraries](mailto:ask@libraries.rutgers.edu) or the [digital humanities librarian](https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/directory/francesca-giannetti) for additional help with sources for your TDM project.

### 2018

This repository is used to maintain and publish a list of digitized and born digital datasets with a Rutgers connection, loosely interpreted. Librarians and archivists participating in the Digital Humanities Working Group at Rutgers University Libraries began this list in 2017 with the ["Collections as Data"](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/) framework in mind. *DH Sources* includes datasets associated with subscription databases, digitized archival collections, and datasets created by Rutgers-affiliated researchers. It is meant to serve as a reference for Rutgers digital humanists looking for datasets to use in their teaching and research.
